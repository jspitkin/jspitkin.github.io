      <p class="job_description"><b>CS 2420 - Introduction to Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</b><br>This course provides an introduction to the problem of engineering computational efficiency into programs. Students will learn about classical algorithms (including sorting, searching, and graph traversal), data structures (including stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, hash tables, and graphs), and analysis of program space and time requirements. Students will complete extensive programming exercises that require the application of elementary techniques from software engineering.</p>

      <p class="job_description"><b>CS 3500 - Software Practice</b><br>Meets with CS 5010. Practical exposure to the process of creating large software systems, including requirements specifications, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Emphasis on software process, software tools (debuggers, profilers, source code repositories, test harnesses), software engineering techniques (time management, code, and documentation standards, source code management, object-oriented analysis and design), and team development practice. Much of the work will be in groups and will involve modifying preexisting software systems.</p>
